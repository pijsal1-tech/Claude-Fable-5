# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **R-101 (T-004):** Deleted the dead `_active_chain_run` module guard in
  `server.py` (it was read at the switch handlers but never assigned, so it
  never blocked anything). Chain dispatch (both the smart-router path and
  `chain_message`) now goes through a thread-safe `ActiveRunHolder`
  (`core/active_run.py`): a second concurrent chain start is rejected with a
  structured `busy` WS frame; the slot is released on `chain_finished`,
  `chain_error`, failed start, and successful `chain_cancel`.
  Model/project switching during an active chain still returns HTTP 409,
  now backed by a guard that actually works.

### Added
- **T-001/T-002/T-003:** pytest infrastructure (`tests/`, `scripts/check.sh`,
  `requirements-dev.txt`), `FakeProvider` + 12-file fixture project
  (`tests/fixtures/sample_project/`), and `core/active_run.py`.
